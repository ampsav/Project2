# Project 2: Machine Learning

This repository contains a python notebook that uses machine learning to predict the causes of wildfires. Being from California, wildfires have become more personal and relevant to me. I'd like to see if I could use what Iâ€™ve learned in my data science class to answer the following: what is the most determining factor when predicting the causes of wildfires? Additionally, we compare CA to UT since I now live in UT.
